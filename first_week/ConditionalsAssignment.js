Get Setup

make a .js file in vs code

Initialize a git repo ("git init" while inside correct folder)

Make a new Github repo

connect local repo and Github repo


In your primary js file complete the following


1. let numberOfStudents = 17;

Check if we have more than 20 students, if yes console log "classroom too small"

else console log "classroom size acceptable"

 

2. 

let numberOfHouses = 5;

Check if this person’s number of houses is greater than 2 - if true console.log(“you need to sell more houses”)

If 2 or less houses - log “seems reasonable”

 

3. 

let bill = 20;

Check if the bill is higher than 15 if yes “we should split the bill” 

If not higher than 15 “I’ll get the bill this time”

 


4. (OPTIONAL) Write an if/else statement for the following requirements:

    If students get 55 or lower: console log "Not to good"
    If students get 60 or lower: console log "ehhhh"
    If students get 70 or lower: console log "Keep trying"
    If students get 80 or lower: console log "nice!"
    If students get 90 or lower: console log "Doing good!"
    else console log "over 90! great!"

5. 

I want you to think of 3 more interesting examples using a simple conditional (checking person’s name, checking person’s age, checking something….)
